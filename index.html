  <p>I used to spend much of my time thinking about what I field I should study since I couldn't
    find out what my calling is in life. <br>
    Someone told me once, I should make a list of things that I'm passionate about in life
    and maybe I could narrow down my
    options. </p>

    <ul> Things that I like
      <li>traveling</li>
      <li>yoga</li>
      <li>photography</li>
      <li>building and creating</li>
    </ul>

<p> This was a good list! I felt good about it. But it was hard not to notice, most of these
      things are going to cost me a lot of money. <br>So I decided in order for to enjoy my life and
      actually do these things I must find a career that would make me money while working remotely.
